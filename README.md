# Binary Arithmetic Visualizations using Pygame 🎮💻

This repository contains Python implementations and interactive **Pygame visualizations** for three key binary arithmetic algorithms:

- ✅ Booth's Multiplication Algorithm  
- 🔁 Restoring Division Algorithm  
- 🔄 Non-Restoring Division Algorithm  

These visual tools are designed to help understand how each algorithm operates step-by-step, making them perfect for educational purposes, demos, or coursework.

## 📁 Contents

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file:

| File Name                    | Algorithm                   | Description |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `Booth's algorithm.py`       | Booth's Multiplication      | Simulates and visualizes step-by-step binary multiplication using Booth's algorithm. |
| `Restoring division algorithm.py`     | Restoring Division          | Visualizes binary division where the remainder is restored if subtraction makes A negative. |
| `Non-restoring division algorithm.py` | Non-Restoring Division      | Visualizes binary division without restoring the remainder in every step. |
